I'm Goutham Sai Pydi, I am a first year MSQE student at the Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata, aiming to graduate in 2026. Previously, I earned my graduate degree in Mathematics from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research in Kolkata, where I gained research experience in the field of econometrics and finance. I have a passion for tackling intricate math puzzles and participating in activities that challenge my mental agility. During my leisure time, I delight in reading, and exploring chess as a novice player.
