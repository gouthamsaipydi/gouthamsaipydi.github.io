Now let’s get straight to the good stuff and explore the magic of Sympy.</p> <p><a href="https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html">Sympy</a> stands for Symbolic Python. It was developed 17 years ago. Be it ODE’s or algebraic equations or solving the diophantine equations algebraically, look no further-Sympy has got you covered.</p> <h3 id="whats-so-special-about-this">What’s so special about this?</h3> <p>As most of you might be aware of the python library <a href="https://numpy.org/">Numpy</a>, which enables you to perform numerical calculations on your data. But Sympy is a bit more abstract in that sense, it enables you to perform symbolic computation(Using symbols)</p> <p>Simply put, we can perform all those nightmare inducing, pain staking and laborious mathematical operations like solving ODEs,substitution, differentiation, integration and even writing the equation in LaTex using sympy.</p> <p>Let me show you the beauty of it. It goes without saying that to use the library you need to first pip it :-}</p> <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="n">sympy</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="o">*</span>

The Planet Earth was home to around 7 (as of now) species of Homo genus, there were Homo erectus in the Indonesian archipelagos, Homo Neandethal in the Europa and our kind in jungles of Eastern Africa.
